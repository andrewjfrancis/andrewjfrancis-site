  A short orientation to how this writing works — and what it avoids.
---

This writing is an archive of structural patterns — how organizations behave under pressure, how decisions create downstream consequences and why capable people fail inside poorly designed systems.

Most writing about work tries to motivate, persuade or offer frameworks. This work is different. It is diagnostic. The goal is recognition: making conditions visible so they can be named, understood and no longer mistaken for personal failure.

Most essays live on Medium. This site organizes them by tags so the archive can be navigated by pattern, not by popularity. Occasionally, a short note will live here directly when it belongs as part of the archive itself.

If something here feels uncomfortably accurate, that is usually the point.
